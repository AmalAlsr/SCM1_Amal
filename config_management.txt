Configuration Management (CM) plays a vital role in modern software engineering. 
It systematically manages changes to software to maintain integrity and traceability throughout the development lifecycle.
Without proper CM, teams are prone to version conflicts, deployment failures, and loss of critical information.
An effective CM process increases transparency, reduces downtime, and ensures the delivery of reliable, consistent software products.
